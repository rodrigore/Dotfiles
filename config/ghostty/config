# - CMD+CTRL+t for workspace switcher
# - CMD+CTRL+T for previous workspace
# - CMD+SHIFT+s for workspace selector
# - CTRL+SHIFT+N for new workspace prompt
# Ghostty has different workspace model, use native Ghostty workspace commands instead

# NOTE: WezTerm copy mode (LEADER+[) not migrated:
# Ghostty uses native selection instead of tmux-style copy mode
# Use mouse or native terminal selection instead

# NOTE: WezTerm resize mode (LEADER+r) not migrated:
# Ghostty doesn't support key tables/modes
# Use direct resize keybindings above instead
